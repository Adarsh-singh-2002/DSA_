>leetcode question : 54

Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
/Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

>leetcode question : 1035 Uncrossed Lines

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2. We write the integers of nums1 and nums2 (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers nums1[i] and nums2[j] such that:

nums1[i] == nums2[j], and
the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

>Leetcode question : 319 Bulb switcher
There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.

On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.

>leetcode question : 1799 Maximize Score After N Operations
You are given nums, an array of positive integers of size 2 * n. You must perform n operations on this array.

In the ith operation (1-indexed), you will:

Choose two elements, x and y.
Receive a score of i * gcd(x, y).
Remove x and y from nums.
Return the maximum score you can receive after performing n operations.

The function gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.

>Leetcode question : 1721 Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k.

Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

>Leetcode question : 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

 >Leetcode question : 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

>Leetcode Question : 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes

Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

>Leetcode Question : 785. Is Graph Bipartite?


There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

>Leetcode question : 399. Evaluate Division

You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

>Leetcode Question : 934. Shortest Bridge

You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any other 1's. There are exactly two islands in grid.

You may change 0's to 1's to connect the two islands to form one island.

Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two islands.

>Leetcode Question : 347. Top K Frequent Elements

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

>Leetcode Question : 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

>Leetcode Question : 77. Combinations

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].
You may return the answer in any order.
Example 1:
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
