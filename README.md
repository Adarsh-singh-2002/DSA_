>leetcode question : 54

Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
/Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

>leetcode question : 1035 Uncrossed Lines

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2. We write the integers of nums1 and nums2 (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers nums1[i] and nums2[j] such that:

nums1[i] == nums2[j], and
the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

>Leetcode question : 319 Bulb switcher
There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.

On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.

>leetcode question : 1799 Maximize Score After N Operations
You are given nums, an array of positive integers of size 2 * n. You must perform n operations on this array.

In the ith operation (1-indexed), you will:

Choose two elements, x and y.
Receive a score of i * gcd(x, y).
Remove x and y from nums.
Return the maximum score you can receive after performing n operations.

The function gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.

>Leetcode question : 1721 Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k.

Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

>Leetcode question : 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

 >Leetcode question : 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.
