Dynamic Programming

Problem Description

Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.

Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.

Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

NOTE:
You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= C <= 103
1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 103
