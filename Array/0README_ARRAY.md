Given an integer array and another integer element. The task is to find if the given element is present in array or not.

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1,2,3,4}
x = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one test case 
with array as {1, 2, 3 4} and element 
to be searched as 3.  Since 3 is 
present at index 2, output is 2.


>Check if two arrays are equal or not

Given two arrays A and B of equal size N, the task is to find if given arrays are equal or not. Two arrays are said to be equal if both of them contain same set of elements, arrangements (or permutation) of elements may be different though.
Note : If there are repetitions, then counts of repeated elements must also be same for two array to be equal.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,5,4,0}
B[] = {2,4,5,0,1}
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the array can be 
rearranged to {0,1,2,4,5}

Find the missing element from an ordered array arr[], consisting of N elements representing an Arithmetic Progression(AP).

Note: There always exists an element which upon inserting into sequence forms Arithmetic progression. Boundary elements (first and last elements) are not missing.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14}
Output: 6
Explanation: Actual AP should be 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.
